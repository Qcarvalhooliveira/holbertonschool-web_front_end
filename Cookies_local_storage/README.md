# **Cookies_local_storage** :computer:

## **Description** :speech_balloon:

Cookies are small pieces of data stored by the browser at the request of websites to "remember" information about the user or their browsing preferences, limited to approximately 4KB, with an expiration date, and sent back to the server with every HTTP request, which can affect performance. On the other hand, Local Storage is part of the Web Storage API, allowing for the storage of larger amounts of data (over 5MB, depending on the browser) in the user's browser without an expiration date and without being sent to the server with every HTTP request, ideal for information that does not require constant communication with the server. While cookies are useful for data that needs to be constantly sent to the server, Local Storage is more efficient for storing large volumes of client-side information that remain in the browser.
