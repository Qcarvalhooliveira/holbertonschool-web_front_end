# Developer tools :computer:

## **Description** :speech_balloon:

* Developer Tools, commonly known as DevTools, are integrated into most web browsers like Google Chrome, Firefox, Safari, and Microsoft Edge, providing a suite of functionalities for web development. These tools allow developers to inspect and modify HTML/CSS in real-time, use a JavaScript console for scripting and logging, monitor network requests and responses to optimize resource delivery, analyze runtime performance through performance profiling, debug JavaScript with features like breakpoints and variable inspection, and test responsive web designs across various screen sizes. DevTools are essential in modern web development for building, debugging, and maintaining web applications.
