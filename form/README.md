# FORM :computer:

## **Description** :speech_balloon:

* HTML forms are an essential part of web development, allowing users to input data that can be sent to a server for processing. An HTML form is defined by the <form> tag, within which various types of input elements can be placed, such as text fields, checkboxes, radio buttons, and submit buttons, to collect user inputs. These elements are defined using tags like <input>, <textarea>, <select>, and others. The action attribute of the <form> tag specifies where the form data should be sent upon submission. The method attribute defines how the data is sent, with the most common methods being GET and POST. The <input> tag is versatile, creating various types of input fields depending on the type attribute. The <label> tag is used to associate a text label with an input element, improving accessibility and user experience. Typically, a submit button is created with <input type="submit"> or <button type="submit">, which sends the form data to the server. For example, a form can be set up to send a POST request to "/submit-data" with the userâ€™s input from a text field named name, with a submit button at the end of the form to trigger the data submission. Forms are a fundamental aspect of interactive websites, enabling user interactions and data collection.
