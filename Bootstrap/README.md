# **Bootstrap** :computer:

## **Description** :speech_balloon:

* Bootstrap is a popular front-end framework designed for web development. It provides a collection of HTML, CSS, and JavaScript tools to create responsive, mobile-first websites and web applications. Bootstrap offers a wide range of pre-styled components, such as navigation bars, buttons, forms, and modals, which make it easier and quicker to develop aesthetically pleasing and functional user interfaces. Its grid system enables developers to create layouts that adapt to various screen sizes, ensuring that websites look good on all devices, from smartphones to desktops. Bootstrap is known for its ease of use and customization, making it a favorite among developers for both rapid prototyping and production projects.
